## Usage

### Sign a Model

```bash
python3 self_verifying_secure.py create models/small_model.pt signed.pt ml_dsa_secret.key ml_dsa_public.key
```

### Verify a Model

```bash
python3 self_verifying_secure.py verify signed.pt
```

### Start Attack Demo Server

```bash
python3 server.py
```


### Run Security Tests

```bash
python3 test_all_models.py
```



## Test Scenarios

The test suite validates four scenarios for each model size:

1. **Normal model + torch.load()** - Baseline loading (succeeds)
2. **Normal + Malicious + torch.load()** - Attack demonstration (RCE executes)
3. **Signed model + torch.load()** - Protected loading (succeeds with verification)
4. **Signed + Malicious + torch.load()** - Attack blocked (signature verification fails)
